### Domain Background
Millions of people suffer from [diabetic retinopathy](https://nei.nih.gov/health/diabetic/retinopathy), the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Generally, this condition is treatable, but it has to be caught early enough. In developing countries like India, the ophthalmologist-patient ratio is at a dismal [1:10,000](https://www.sankaranethralaya.org/a-step-towards-combating-blindness-in-rural-areas.html). Therefore, the ability to automatize the screening process for this and other eye conditions is fundamental to prevent this disease effectively, especially in populations living in rural areas.
